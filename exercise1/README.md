# Exercise 1: Your First AI Trivia Quiz (CLI)

Goal (≈30 min): Build a tiny command‑line quiz that:

1. Generates a trivia question using a local Ollama model
2. Shows the question to the player and captures their answer
3. (Optional) Asks the model to judge if the answer is correct
4. Prints a final score

This is designed for first‑time AI experimentation. Focus on getting a simple loop working. Fancy features can come later.

## 1. Setup

Install dependencies (already done if you ran `npm install`):

```
npm install
```

Run (will do nothing interesting yet):

```
node index.js
```
